		<h4>How to create a script that will automatically run when called?</h4>
		<h2> Each time you want to pull changes from your git repository to your remote server, you need to do the same routine. </h2>
		<li> Log to your server - ssh user@server.ip </li>
		<li> Get to the specific file where your work is being kept - cd /var/www </li>
		<li> Pull the work from git repo - git pull </li>
		<li> Hope that it all worked </li>
		<h2> However, you can make your life easier by creeating a script that will do all those things for you, each time you run it. Ok, easy peazy, but how should I do it? Let me tell you...</h2>
		<li> Get to the folder where you keep your project </li>
		<li> Create a file that will have a name of your command - vim remote_gitpull.sh</li>
		<li> Type your shell script. That's where you want to type exactly the same routine you would do - ssh user@server.ip "cd /var/www/html/blog; git pull origin master" </li>
		<li> Save changes </li>
		<p> Now you can pull changes from git repo by calling your script. Remamber that you need to be in a folder where you created it. That's why it's a good idea to keep it in your project. - ./remote_gitpull.sh </p>
